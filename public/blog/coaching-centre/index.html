        <p class="intro">
          For decades, students from smaller cities have faced a difficult choice: either compromise on quality education locally or migrate to expensive metro cities for better opportunities. Exameets Skillverse Academy in Kadapa is challenging this narrative by bringing industry-standard tech education right to students' doorsteps.
        </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>The Problem with Traditional Tech Education</h2>
          <p>Most coaching institutes in tier-2 and tier-3 cities focus heavily on theoretical knowledge without practical application. Students graduate with certificates but lack the hands-on experience that employers demand. This gap forces many to either accept lower-paying jobs or spend additional years and money in metro cities to become truly job-ready.</p>
          
          <p>The founders of Exameets Skillverse—Likith Sarma Jandyala, Santhosh Kumar Anantha, Veera Prasad Kommisetty, and Venkata Sivaram Krishna Macha—recognized this problem from their own experiences in the tech industry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>A Different Approach to Learning</h2>
          <p>What sets Exameets apart is their focus on practical, industry-relevant skills over academic theory. Instead of large lecture halls, they maintain small batches of maximum 15 students, ensuring personalized attention for each learner.</p>

          <div class="stats">

              <span class="stat-number">15</span>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The academy's modular structure includes assessments at every stage, ensuring students master each concept before moving forward. This approach, combined with unlimited retries for certifications, removes the pressure of one-time exams while maintaining quality standards.</p>
